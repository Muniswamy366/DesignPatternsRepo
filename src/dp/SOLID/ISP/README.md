### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Don't force a class to implement interfaces it doesn't use.

The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.


LSP segrigating related classes under one umbrilla, ISP is used to segrigate method into specific interface.
