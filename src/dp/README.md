### Cohesion

Cohesion is the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together. It means “the code that changes together, stays together”. High cohesion (easy to understand and much more readable) is recommended.

Coupling is the degree of interdependence between software modules. The coupling is about how changing one thing required change in another.
