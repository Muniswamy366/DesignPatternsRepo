What is SSL/TLS?

    TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the protocol that secures communication over a network.

    SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is its older version (now obsolete).

    ⚠️ In modern systems, when we say SSL, we usually mean TLS.


  Without TLS, traffic is plain-text, vulnerable to:

        Snooping (MITM attacks)

        Tampering

        Impersonation

TLS secures:

    🔒 External API communication (e.g., from browser → gateway)

    🔐 Internal service-to-service communication


1️⃣ External TLS (HTTPS)

Clients <=> API Gateway <=> Microservices

    Traffic between external clients and the gateway uses TLS

    Usually with public certificates

✅ Example: Client → HTTPS → https://api.company.com  
2️⃣ Internal TLS (Service-to-Service)

Microservice A <=> Microservice B (over HTTPS/gRPC)

    Encrypts internal communication between services

    Often uses mutual TLS (mTLS) for extra security

✅ Example: https://inventory-service:8081/products  

Where TLS is Used in Microservices

| Layer                        | Role of TLS                        | Example                               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 🧍 Client ↔ API Gateway      | Secure external access             | HTTPS on public endpoints             |
| 🔁 Service ↔ Service         | Internal traffic encryption        | Order → Payment microservice          |
| 📦 Service ↔ DB/Queue        | Protect DB/Kafka/Redis connections | TLS connection to MongoDB or RabbitMQ |
| 🚀 Gateway ↔ Identity Server | Secure auth tokens and sessions    | OAuth2 server with HTTPS              |
