What is SSL/TLS?

    TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the protocol that secures communication over a network.

    SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is its older version (now obsolete).

    ‚ö†Ô∏è In modern systems, when we say SSL, we usually mean TLS.


  Without TLS, traffic is plain-text, vulnerable to:

        Snooping (MITM attacks)

        Tampering

        Impersonation

TLS secures:

    üîí External API communication (e.g., from browser ‚Üí gateway)

    üîê Internal service-to-service communication


1Ô∏è‚É£ External TLS (HTTPS)

Clients <=> API Gateway <=> Microservices

    Traffic between external clients and the gateway uses TLS

    Usually with public certificates

‚úÖ Example: Client ‚Üí HTTPS ‚Üí https://api.company.com  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Internal TLS (Service-to-Service)

Microservice A <=> Microservice B (over HTTPS/gRPC)

    Encrypts internal communication between services

    Often uses mutual TLS (mTLS) for extra security

‚úÖ Example: https://inventory-service:8081/products  

#### One-Way vs Mutual TLS

| Type        | Client Authenticates Server? | Server Authenticates Client? | Use Case                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| TLS (1-way) | ‚úÖ                            | ‚ùå                            | Standard HTTPS                    |
| mTLS        | ‚úÖ                            | ‚úÖ                            | Service-to-service authentication |


#### Where TLS is Used in Microservices

| Layer                        | Role of TLS                        | Example                               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| üßç Client ‚Üî API Gateway      | Secure external access             | HTTPS on public endpoints             |
| üîÅ Service ‚Üî Service         | Internal traffic encryption        | Order ‚Üí Payment microservice          |
| üì¶ Service ‚Üî DB/Queue        | Protect DB/Kafka/Redis connections | TLS connection to MongoDB or RabbitMQ |
| üöÄ Gateway ‚Üî Identity Server | Secure auth tokens and sessions    | OAuth2 server with HTTPS              |

#### How to Enable TLS in Microservices (Spring Boot Example)  
```
server:
  port: 8443
  ssl:
    key-store: classpath:keystore.p12
    key-store-password: password
    key-store-type: PKCS12
    key-alias: orderservice
```
keystore.p12 contains the server certificate and private key.  

#### TLS for Internal Services (Mutual TLS)

You can also use mutual TLS (mTLS), where:

    Both client and server present certificates

    Common in zero-trust architectures or service mesh environments

    Mutual TLS is important for service-to-service authentication, not just encryption.

#### Tools That Help with TLS

| Tool             | Purpose                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Cert-Manager** | Auto-manage TLS certs in Kubernetes |
| **Istio**        | Enable mTLS between services        |
| **Spring Boot**  | Easy TLS server setup               |
| **Envoy**        | TLS termination and routing         |

### Summary

    TLS in microservices protects data in transit, verifies who you‚Äôre talking to, and is essential in modern secure architectures.

    üîê Use TLS for all HTTP/gRPC traffic ‚Äî external and internal

    ‚úÖ Consider mTLS for service-to-service auth

    üåê Use a service mesh or API gateway to manage it at scale

### How TLS Works in Practice
When a service sends an HTTPS request:

    The client requests a secure connection.

    The server sends back its TLS certificate.

    The client:

        Validates the certificate

        Negotiates encryption keys

    Now both sides encrypt/decrypt using a shared session key.

In mutual TLS, both sides validate each other's certificates.
