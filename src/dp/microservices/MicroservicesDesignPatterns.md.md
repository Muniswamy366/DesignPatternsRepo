ðŸ”¹ a. Decompose by Business Capability  

    Each service owns one business area.  
    ðŸ“Œ Example: UserService, OrderService, PaymentService.  

ðŸ”¹ b. Decompose by Subdomain (from Domain-Driven Design)  

    Based on Bounded Contexts.  
    ðŸ“Œ Example: Customer in CRM â‰  Customer in Billing.  

### 2. Integration Patterns
Used to make microservices talk to each other.  
ðŸ”¹ a. API Gateway

    Entry point for all clients.

    ðŸ“Œ Example: Netflix Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong.

ðŸ”¹ b. Service Registry & Discovery

    Dynamically find service instances.
    ðŸ“Œ Example: Eureka, Consul.
