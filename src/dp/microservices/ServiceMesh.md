| **Load Balancing**    | Spread traffic across service instances                             |  
| **Traffic Routing**   | Canary deployments, versioned routing, blue-green                   |  
| **Observability**     | Metrics, logs, and distributed tracing                              |  
| **Security**          | Mutual TLS (mTLS), encryption, authentication, authorization        |  
| **Resilience**        | Retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, rate limiting                  |  
| **Policy Control**    | Define and enforce communication rules (e.g., who can talk to whom) |  


A service mesh is an infrastructure layer for managing communication between microservices. It ensures that services can discover, connect, secure, observe, and control their interactions â€” without changing application code.
