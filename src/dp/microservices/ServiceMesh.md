A service mesh is an infrastructure layer for managing communication between microservices. It ensures that services can discover, connect, secure, observe, and control their interactions — without changing application code.

### Core Idea

In a microservices architecture, you have many small services talking to each other. This inter-service communication can be complex — involving security, reliability, routing, and observability. A service mesh solves this by moving those concerns out of your services and into a dedicated communication layer, typically implemented using sidecar proxies (e.g., Envoy).
