A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication in microservices architectures. It provides critical capabilities like traffic management, security, observability, and reliability—without requiring changes in application code.  

A service mesh is an infrastructure layer for managing communication between microservices. It ensures that services can discover, connect, secure, observe, and control their interactions — without changing application code.    

### Why Do We Need a Service Mesh?

#### 1. Traffic Management  

    Load balancing: Distributes requests across multiple instances.
    Routing: Canary deployments, blue-green deployments, A/B testing.
    Retries and timeouts: Automatic retrying of failed requests, avoiding cascading failures.
    Circuit breakers: Stops calling failing services to reduce strain.

#### 2. Security  

    * Mutual TLS (mTLS): Encrypts and authenticates all service-to-service traffic.
    * Zero-trust networking: Each service must prove its identity before communication.
    * Policy enforcement: Control which services can talk to which (authorization).

#### 3. Observability  

    * Distributed tracing: See how a request travels across multiple services.

    * Metrics: Automatic collection of success rates, latency, error rates, etc.

    * Logging: Centralized logs to understand traffic and debug issues.

#### 4. Resilience

    * Failure handling: Retries, failovers, and timeouts improve system robustness.

    * Rate limiting and throttling: Prevent services from being overwhelmed.

#### 5. Decouples Business Logic from Communication Logic  

    Without a service mesh, each microservice must implement logic for:

        TLS encryption

        Retries

        Metrics/logging

        Authorization

    This bloats the codebase and introduces duplication.  

    A service mesh offloads this to infrastructure (typically via sidecar proxies, like Envoy in Istio).  

### Common Use Cases

    Large-scale microservices applications

    Kubernetes environments

    Need for zero-trust security and fine-grained access control

    Want centralized control over routing and traffic policies

### Popular Service Meshes

    Istio (most feature-rich)

    Linkerd (lightweight and simple)

    Consul Connect

    AWS App Mesh

    NGINX Service Mesh

| **Resilience**        | Retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, rate limiting                  |  
| **Policy Control**    | Define and enforce communication rules (e.g., who can talk to whom) |
