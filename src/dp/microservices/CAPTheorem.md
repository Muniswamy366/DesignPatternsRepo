What is the CAP Theorem?
The CAP theorem states that a distributed data system can only guarantee two out of the following three properties at any given time:  

| Property                | Description                                                                                          |  
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  
| Consistency (C)         | Every read receives the most recent write or an error. All nodes see the same data at the same time. |  
| Availability (A)        | Every request (read or write) receives a response-even if some nodes are down.                       |  
| Partition Tolerance (P) | The system continues to function despite communication breakdowns between nodes.                     |
