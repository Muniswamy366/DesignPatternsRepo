### CQRS
CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. Itâ€™s a pattern that separates:  
Commands (write/update operations)  
Queries (read operations)

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
- To optimize performance, scalability, and security by handling reads and writes separately.

#### When to Use  
âœ… Use CQRS when:

- High read/write load

- Complex business logic on commands

- Need different scaling for read and write

- Event sourcing or distributed systems involved

ðŸš« Avoid CQRS when:

- Simple CRUD system

- Low scalability needs

- Team isnâ€™t experienced in handling eventual consistency
