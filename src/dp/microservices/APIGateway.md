**What it does:**
A single entry point for all clients to interact with backend microservices.

**Why use it:**

Decouples clients from services.

Centralized routing, authentication, rate limiting.

**Tools:**
Kong, Spring Cloud Gateway, Zuul, NGINX, Ambassador.  

**An API Gateway is a server that:**

* Acts as a reverse proxy to route requests to multiple microservices

* Handles authentication, authorization, rate limiting, load balancing, caching, and request/response transformation

#### Why Use an API Gateway?
In a microservices architecture, each service is independently deployable and might expose its own API. Without a gateway:  

* Clients must call multiple services directly.  
* Each service must handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, etc.  

**Reverse Proxy:**  
A reverse proxy is a server that sits between clients and backend servers (like web or application servers). It forwards client requests to the appropriate backend server, then returns the serverâ€™s response back to the client.  

### Reverse Proxy vs Forward Proxy

| Feature           | Reverse Proxy                      | Forward Proxy                         |  
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |  
| Acts on behalf of | Server                             | Client                                |  
| Used by           | Server-side (e.g., load balancing) | Client-side (e.g., content filtering) |  
| Hides             | Backend servers                    | Clients                               |  

#### How They Work
ðŸ”¹ Forward Proxy (Client-Side Proxy)  
Client â†’ Forward Proxy â†’ Internet  

Example: Your office network blocks YouTube; you configure a proxy to access it.  

ðŸ”¹ Reverse Proxy (Server-Side Proxy)  
Client â†’ Reverse Proxy â†’ Web Servers  

Example: A website uses NGINX as a reverse proxy to route traffic to various microservices.
