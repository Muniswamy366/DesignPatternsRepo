#### What is gRPC?

gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework developed by Google.  

It allows client and server applications to communicate directly by calling methods on remote objects as if they were local.  
It is built on:  

    HTTP/2 for transport
    Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for serialization
    Auto-generated client/server code for multiple languages
